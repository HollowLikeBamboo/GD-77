Reading the GD-77 internal flash is now much easier.

1. Upload a flash readout patched firmware with the GD-77 updater.
2. Use the updated flashmanager to read out the internal flash.
   (Check the "Read internal Flash" checkbox, choose
    startaddress+length and then press the read button.)

Just to be on the safe side:
Even if the firmware should be fully functional please don't forget to upload the unmodified
original firmware to your GD-77 afterwards to get your TRX into a clean state again.

"gd77 firmware updater" contains the Radioddity GD-77 firmware update tool.

That's it, have fun!
