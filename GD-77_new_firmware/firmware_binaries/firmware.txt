- Support for HR-C6000.
- Pin definitions and initialization for I2C, SPI, I2S, AT1846, HR-C6000 and some common pins.
- Added beep task for sounds.
- Added key and buttons sounds.
- Added melody system + startup melody + hidden melodies.
- Added data structure for mode (anlog/DMR), band (VHF/UHF) and frequency.
- Made mode, band and frequency editable.
    - Frequency is checked to stay in band range (VHF: 144 MHz - 146 MHz / UHF: 430 MHz - 440 MHz).
    - Use digit keys to enter frequency.
    - Left key is backspace.
    - Green key is ok (partially entered frequency will get padded with zeros).
    - Red key is cancel.
    - Up/down keys step frequency by +/- 12.5 KHz.
    - Star key toggles mode analog/DMR.
    - Hash key toggles band VHF/UHF.
    - Keys have special sounds for ok, cancel and wrong frequency.
- Display shows mode, band and frequency.
- Added additional default mode "Silent".
- Australian bandwith limits for the time beeing.
- Added functionality for FM analog mode.
- Added squelch for analog mode (with open/shut option via menu).
- Linker magic and data files for codec reuse (the data files contain only dummy data to avoid copyright issues).
- MCU+PC part of comtool.
- HR-C6000 DMR interrupt stuff.
- MCU+PC part of packet data logging stuff.
- Added basic HR-C6000 packet receive handling for DMR mode.
- Added HR-C6000 packet data logging.
- Added menu option to enable/disable HR-C6000 datalogging.
- Display the flags (squelch, datalogging) that can be changed via menu.
- Added transmission state machine with start/stop/interrupt/lateentry logic.
- Added soundbuffer system that continously sends data via SAI/EDMA SPI/I2S to the HR-C6000.
- Took some uncritical AMBE support stuff from https://github.com/szechyjs/dsd and https://github.com/szechyjs/mbelib.
- Init and call the AMBE codec. (Copyright disclaimer: THIS IS NOT THE AMBE CODEC ITSELF! IT IS ONLY A STUB THAT CALLS INTO THE ORIGINAL FIRMWARE CODE!)

- Added better RX LED handling.

V0.0.1c:
- Optimized the packet handling algorithm again.
- RTT optimization.
- Added tool to create *.dat files.
- More detailed packet logging.

V0.0.1d:
