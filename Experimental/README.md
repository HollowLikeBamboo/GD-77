This folder contains very hacky stuff only ...

The various hacked copies of Roger Clarks community CPS were taken from https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/radioddity_gd-77_cps.git

"gd77 firmware updater" contains the Radioddity GD-77 firmware update tool.

"full flash readout" contains the tools for a hacky full flash readout. Please refer to the readme for details.

"cpu-id readout" contains tools to calculate the data necessary to patch "full_flash.dat" so that the bootloader
and the main application survive their CPU-UID checks.
